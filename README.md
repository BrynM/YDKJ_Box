# YDKJ_Box

A case/box/contraption for three game show style player button controllers to be used playing [You Don't Know Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Don%27t_Know_Jack_\(video_game_series\)) (available on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/33692/)). This package is geared toward fun and portability. The "controllers" attach to a box containing a portable PC such as a [Zotac PI320](https://www.zotac.com/us/product/mini_pcs/pi320) with a [small bluetooth keyboard](http://www.centralcomputers.com/p-383937-comkia-mobikeys-b405-bluetooth-keyboardwith-touchpadproduct.aspx) and some circuitry based on the [Arduino Micro](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMicro) used as a HID keyboard. The bluetooth keyboard is required for the bonus round questions despite these additional controls.
