# YDKJ_Box

A box for three game show style player button controllers for playing You Don't Know Jack. This package is geared toward fun and portability. the "controllers" attach to a box containing a portable PC such as a Zotac PI320 with a small bluetooth keyboard and some circuitry based on the Arduino Mini. A small bluetooth keyboard for the bonus round questions is a must despite these controls, so have one ready.

YDKJ is available on Steam.
